        <h3>Now please enjoy this curated list of appallingly cheesy Christian pick-up lines that I found on the internet:</h3>

        <h3>
            For you I would slay two Goliaths.<br>
            You float my ark.<br>
            Is it hot in here or is that just the Holy Spirit burning inside of you?<br>
            I believe one of my ribs belongs to you.<br>
            I didn’t know angels flew this low.<br>
            Is it a sin that you stole my heart?<br>
            You make the Queen of Sheba look like a hobo.<br>
            Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?<br>
            You and me, we’re like loaves and fishes. We just might be a miracle together.<br>
            I was reading my Bible the other day, and I was wondering if you know what Paul meant by “greet one another
            with a holy kiss?”<br>
            You make me want to be a better tither.<br>
